			<h3 class="red editable">Amplify is a public art and design initiative that partners an artist or designer with a non-profit organization working on the front lines of social justice. The initiative’s aim is to create thought-provoking posters on themes relevant to each organization. The posters will be showcased on streetscape exhibition panels, in a wheat-pasting campaign and at the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City.</h3>

			<p class="grey editable">We are producing this project to support and publicize the work of NYC-based non-profits addressing a wide range of social justice concerns. These organizations often play a key role in protecting the inherent dignity of New Yorkers, helping the underserved to achieve their full potential and practice uninhibited expression of their rights. The work of these organizations is circuitous, challenging and frequently lacks visibility.</p> 
			<div class="clear"><br></div>
			<p class="grey editable">Typically, these organizations do not have the financial capacity to communicate their work beyond their core supporters.</p>

				<p class="grey editable">To address this predicament, Amplify will spotlight the work of these organizations in high-traffic neighborhoods – through a streetscape exhibition and wheat-pasting campaign, an exhibition at the Museum of Arts and Design, a dedicated website, and social media campaign – helping to promote their path-breaking missions in a time of heightened political and social tension.</p>
