			<h3 class="red editable">AMPL!FY is a public art and design initiative that partners an artist or designer with a non-profit organization working on the front lines of social justice to create thought-provoking posters on themes relevant to each organization.</h3>
			<div class="clear"><br /></div>
			<p class="grey editable">Launching in New York City on November 2, 2017, AMPL!FY is organized by Make Art with Purpose (MAP) and Worldstudio and produced in partnership with New York City Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Art Program, Museum of Arts and Design and Harlem Stage. The posters will be showcased on New York City Department of Transportation&rsquo;s Art Program&rsquo;s art display cases and in an exhibition at the Museum of Arts and Design.<br /><br />AMPL!FY uses public art, exhibitions, community engagement and social media to support and promote the work of non-profits addressing a range of social justice concerns. We believe in an equitable, just and prosperous world for all people. AMPL!FY promotes these values by helping to sustain and support the mission of organizations working on social and climate justice issues. These organizations often play a key role in protecting people&rsquo;s inherent dignity, helping the underserved to achieve their full potential and practice uninhibited expression of their rights. The work of these organizations is circuitous, challenging and frequently lacks visibility. Typically, these organizations do not have the financial capacity to communicate their work beyond their core supporters.<br /><br />In a time of heightened political and social tension, AMPL!FY was founded by artist Janeil Engelstad / Make Art with Purpose (MAP) and designer Mark Randall / Worldstudio to leverage the power of art and design to amplify the issues addressed by non-profit organizations with missions that support the evolution of humanity as a whole.<br /><br /><strong>If you&rsquo;re an organization looking to work on a similar initiative, contact janeil@mac.com or mrandall@worldstudioinc.com.</strong></p>
