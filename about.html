	<h3 class="red editable">AMPL!FY is a public art and design initiative that partners an artist or designer with a
		non-profit organization working on the front lines of social justice to create thought-provoking posters on
		themes relevant to each organization.</h3>
	<p class="grey">
		Organized by Make Art with Purpose (MAP) and Worldstudio, AMPL!FY took place in New York City from 2017 through
		2019. The project was produced in partnership with New York City Department of Transportation’s Art Program,
		Museum of Arts and Design and Harlem Stage. The posters were showcased on New York City Department of
		Transportation’s Art Program’s, as well as in an exhibition at the Museum of Arts and Design. In addition to
		streetscape installations and museum exhibition, AMPL!FLY included public programs to advance the project themes
		and to support the work of partnering non-profits. </p>

	<p class="grey">We believe in an equitable, just and prosperous world for all people and promote these
		values by helping to
		sustain and support the mission of organizations working on social justice issues. These organizations often
		play a key role in protecting people’s inherent dignity, helping the underserved to achieve their full potential
		and practice uninhibited expression of their rights. The work of these organizations is circuitous, challenging
		and frequently lacks visibility. Typically, these organizations do not have the financial capacity to
		communicate their work beyond their core supporters.</p>

	<p class="grey">In a time of heightened political and social tension, AMPL!FY was founded to amplify the
		issues addressed by
		non-profit organizations with missions that support the evolution of humanity as a whole.</p>
