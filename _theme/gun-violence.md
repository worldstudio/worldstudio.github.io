  <p>Edel Rodriguez is a Cuban American artist whose work has been exhibited
  internationally. Inspired by personal history, religious rituals, politics,
  memory, and nostalgia, his bold, figurative works are an examination of
  identity, cultural displacement and mortality. Socialist propaganda and
  western advertising, island culture and contemporary city life are all aspects
  of his life that continue to inform his work. Rodriguez has created artwork
  for numerous clients, including The New York Times, TIME Magazine and The New
  Yorker.</p>
