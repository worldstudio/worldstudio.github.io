quote: More Americans have died from gun violence than in all this countryâ€™s wars.
main_entry: >-
  Each year in the U.S., over 33,000 Americans are killed by gun violence, and
  more than 84,000 are injured. Over the past 50 years, more than 1.4 million
  Americans have been killed, and 3.5 million have been injured by firearms.

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gun violence is the third leading cause of death among
  American youth &ndash; and homicide&ndash;by&ndash;firearm is the leading
  cause of death among black youth ages 15&ndash;24. In New York City,
  under&ndash;served communities of color are disproportionately impacted by the
  flow of illegal guns from states with lax gun laws.</p>
right_p_html: >-
  <p>There are many factors that lead disenfranchised youth to pick up guns: the
  cycle of violence is perpetuated by chronic loss, traumatic stress and grief,
  poverty, inadequate schools and housing, unemployment, and
  incarceration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Preventative education must go deeper than
  explaining the dangers of gun violence and the potential for injury, death or
  prison. Empowering young people with leadership skills &ndash; including
  conflict resolution, public speaking and advocacy training &ndash; provides a
  powerful antidote to the cycle of helplessness and violence plaguing our most
  vulnerable neighborhoods.</p>
