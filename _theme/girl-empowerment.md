  The effects of inner-city social turmoil that took place in the 1960’s and
  70’s throughout the nation hit the Lower East Side community in Manhattan very
  hard. The neighborhood experienced unprecedented real estate abandonment and
  disinvestment as riots flared, buildings burned and drugs were rampant.

  <p>Today, the Lower East Side remains one of the most ethnically and
  economically diverse neighborhoods in New York, with a substantial
  foreign-born and working-poor population. Poverty rates in the Lower East Side
  remain amongst the highest in the city, in spite of a recent influx of
  affluent residents. In fact, the Lower East Side has the third highest number
  of young people living in poverty in Manhattan, approximately
  39.6%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, 47.3% of Lower East Side residents are on
  some form of income support, and around 30% live in households with incomes
  below $19,000. The census tracts along the East River indicate that, in 2010,
  over half of families with children had incomes below the poverty line.</p>
