  Many young people are articulating ever more varied understandings of gender
  in themselves and their peers. They are also encountering a world around them
  that is unprepared, if not downright hostile, in its responses.

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>From their own families to the communities and institutions
  with which they interact, gender non- conforming youth are facing rejection,
  discrimination and bullying at levels well beyond their equals.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Without a shared understanding of gender and sexual identities,
  interactions can often occur with unanticipated &ndash; and even harmful
  &ndash; consequences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parents play a very powerful role in
  a gender&ndash; expansive youth&rsquo;s life. Research shows that supportive
  parenting significantly affects children&rsquo;s outlook on life, mental
  health and self&ndash;esteem. Rejecting parenting practices appear to be
  directly correlated to gender-expansive and transgender youth being more
  depressed and suicidal. The most crucial thing parents can do is to allow
  their gender non-conforming children to be exactly who they are.</p>
