  Programs in theater and storytelling offer young people whose voices are often
  unheard the empowering experience of creating their own narratives and sharing
  them with their communities.

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although research shows that arts programming narrows the
  achievement gap between youth of high versus low socioeconomic status, arts
  education in New York City public schools remains woefully underfunded.</p>
right_p_html: >-
  <p>Worse yet, students attending schools in economically under-served
  communities have disproportionately poorer access to arts resources than those
  in more affluent areas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Youth who participate in arts
  programming do better across the board academically, with higher grades and
  test scores as well as increased high school graduation rates and college
  enrollment. They become more active and engaged citizens by voting,
  volunteering, and engaging in school and local politics.</p>

  <p>Founded in 2000 by actors and educators, Opening Act seeks to level the
  playing field for our students by specifically partnering with NYC schools
  that have lower than average graduation rates (as few as 33% of students
  graduating in four years) and a lack of theater programming. Opening Act gives
  high school students opportunities to develop leadership, community, and
  commitment through its innovative, high quality, free, After-School Theater
  Program.</p>
