quote: Imagine a world without imperialism.
main_entry: >-
  If you can conceive of a world without America – without everything America
  stands for and everything it does in the world – then you’ve already taken
  great strides and begun to get at least a glimpse of a whole new world.

right_p_html: >-
  <p>If you can envision a world without any imperialism, exploitation,
  oppression &ndash; and the whole philosophy that rationalizes it &ndash; a
  world without division into classes or even different nations, and all the
  narrow&ndash; minded, selfish, outmoded ideas that uphold this; if you can
  envision all this, then you have the basis for proletarian internationalism.
  And once you have raised your sights to all this, how could you not feel
  compelled to take an active part in the world historic struggle to realize it;
  why would you want to lower your sights to anything
  less?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>BAsics from the Talks and Writings of Bob

  <p>Dread Scott makes revolutionary art to propel history forward. He first
  received national attention in 1989 when his art became the center of
  controversy over its use of the American flag, while he was a student at the
  School of the Art Institute of Chicago. His work is in the collections of the
  Whitney Museum, the New Museum of Contemporary Art (NY) and the Akron Art
  Museum, and has been included in recent exhibitions at MoMA PS1, the Walker
