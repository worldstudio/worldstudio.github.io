quote: Ethnic bias and stereotyping erode the stability of American families.
main_entry: >-
  Dangerous political rhetoric has contributed to a significant rise in
  incidents of Islamophobic bias in the United States and abroad. From 2014 to
  2016, antiâ€“Muslim bias incidents jumped 65 percent. In that two-year period,
  hate crimes targeting Muslims surged 584 percent.

  <p>Religious beliefs were not the only trigger of anti&ndash;Muslim bias
  incidents. The victim&rsquo;s ethnicity or national origin accounted for 35
  percent of the total, and in many cases an individual&rsquo;s name was the
  lone trigger factor. Xenophobic policies and propaganda exert a heavy human
  toll; increasingly, families are torn apart by regressive immigration policies
  based on ethnic profiling. In American schools, reports of violence and
  bullying of Muslim students continue to rise and, alarmingly, some of the
  reported incidents involve faculty rather than other students. Islamophobia,
  xenophobia and discrimination do not have to be our reality. Together, we can
  reject hate and unburden our nation from continued a affliction.</p>
