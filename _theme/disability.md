quote: Does disability need a re-design?
main_entry: >-
  In 1997, a group of architects and designers developed the Seven Principles of
  Universal Design. The first principle spells out the rules of Equitable Use:
  the design must be useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.
left_p_html: >-
  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Surprisingly, none of the 7 Principles of Universal Design
  prioritizes aesthetic or emotional connection, an apparent oversight that may
  have contributed to a lack of visually pleasing assistive devices, and all but
  stigmatized the appearance of the products disabled people need most. Does
  disability need a re-design?</p>
right_p_html: >-
  <p>Products made for disabled people are rarely designed for esthetic
  consideration, and for many disabled consumers disability is all but
  equivalent to a lack of choice. Assistive devices always end up stigmatizing
  their user.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to the National Institute of Health,
  for example, only one-fifth of people who could bene t from hearing aids
  actually use them. Failure to use hearing aids can lead to early-onset
  dementia and even early death, and yet many people reject their use because of
  the social stigma associated with them. Could this stigma actually be deadly?
  And can design restore dignity to those who are branded
  &ldquo;disabled&rdquo;?</p>
