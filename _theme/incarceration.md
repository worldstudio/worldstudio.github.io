issue: Incarceration
quote: >-
  The U.S. has 5% of the world's population, and 25% of the world's
  incarcerated.
main_entry: >-
  America is at a tipping point. In a country that continues to lead the world
  in locking up its own people, mass incarceration has emerged as a defining
  civil rights issue. In a time of deep ideological divides, the fight for
  justice is more urgent than ever.
left_p_html: >-
  <p>And it starts in local jails in nearly every community, where millions of
  men and women &ndash; who are presumed innocent -&nbsp; are locked up over the
  course of a year. Most are behind bars for minor offenses, and held because
  they are simply too poor to post bail. Runaway use of incarceration
  dehumanizes people, and targets and damages already marginalized communities
  &ndash; people who are poor, people of color, people with mental illness.</p>
right_p_html: >-
  <p>The need to reform our criminal justice system remains a point of agreement
  among public leaders of red and blue states alike, as well as the local
  government actors who are in charge of delivering much needed changes to our
  nation&rsquo;s justice system.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mass incarceration and its
  solutions are in our backyards. Together we can build stronger communities
  and, overall, a safer U.S.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
