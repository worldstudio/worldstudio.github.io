quote: It’s warming. It’s us. We’re sure. It’s bad. It’s urgent. We can fix it.

  Climate change isn’t a distant, abstract problem – it’s here now. People all
  over the world are feeling the impacts, from island nations going underwater
  to indigenous lands being exploited for fossil fuel extraction. Earth has
  always had natural cycles of warming and cooling, but never like what we’re
  seeing now.

  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>As of this writing, the top five hottest years on record are
  2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2010. 2017 so far is the second&ndash;hottest year
  on record, after 2016.</p>

 <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Climate change is not just an environmental issue, or a social justice
  issue, or an economic issue. It is one of the biggest challenges humanity has
  ever faced, and the consequences impact everything from food shortages to mass
  migration to escalating political discord and conflict. It is essential that
  we work together to solve the climate crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That means
  bringing people together &ndash; not just environmentalists, but business
  owners, faith groups, labor unions, universities and others &ndash; and
  building coalitions strong enough to put pressure on governments, and stand up
  to the fossil fuel industry. We cannot a afford to wait any longer, we need
  true climate action now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
